--- Basicall Dev Log -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dont care didnt ask

M4:
"You literally have no reason to use any other weapon"
Precision Handguard
"Older design that some how is more accurate than the modern one. Really makes you question the decisions of the devs"
Prototype Receiver 
"Magically increases damage while reduce rpm for apparantly no reasons"
20 Round .303 Mag
"Hey why did they change the calibre?"

Support Handguard
"Thicc A1 handguard"
Belt-Fed Receiver
"Unlocks the 120 Round Magazine. Somehow still able to use normal box ones, really makes you think why they didn't just let you have a normal 120 round box magazine, surely balancing isn't the reason"
120 Round Mag
"Funky box with extra bullets"

Whisper Handguard
"Silencer with extra steps, magically reduce firerate"
Sliding Stock
"No you can't close it"

32 Round 9mm Mag
"Look! It's got a proper converter now"
Wire Stock
"IT'S NOT EVEN THE CORRECT STOCK"

Defiant Kit
"Hey why doesn't this one have a proper remodel"
Full Stock
"Not that kind of full"

Long Handguard
"Dev is really running out of names"
Antique Handguard
"Jamming simulator, jam not included"
No Handguard
"Of course, a standard with any weapon that allows customisation, the most lazy but somehow always worth a chuckle"

Gilber Kit
"Buy one get one free! Comes with an alternating or simultaneous firemode"
Little Italy Mag
"Of course there's a 9mm version. But why isn't it upside down I hear you cry"
Chimera Kit
"Surely making the magwell slightly curved is enough to fit a bigger calibre, you don't need an entirely different barrel for it"
Predator Kit
"Bolt action converter for sniper rounds. Don't ask how the bolt handle travel that far without clipping into the stock"
Marksman Stock
"Looks lighter than most other stock yet somehow dampen recoils more"
Sweeper Kit
"The lord shan't forgive your sins. Of course it comes with a drum mag"
Ranger Kit
"Ah yes, the ancient weapon that stand the test of time, now available for your m4. Explosive tip for obvious reasons"

Chainsaw Grip
"Really makes you feel retarded holding this"
Chainsaw Foregrip
"Good luck aiming"
Skeleton Grip
"Becausea that amount of weight saved is really the defactor of life and death"




AK:
Woodsman Handguard
"Longest Boi"
Infiltrator Handguard
"IVAN, THIS IS NOT 80s RUSSIAN STANDARD"
Oppressor Handguard
"The hell? It's just slightly longer"
Stalker Handguard
"Mate just use a silencer"
